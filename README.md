## About This Project

![landing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa0ee5c8-4ac8-43f3-806f-9f484cae3139)

This repo is the landing page for Comed! Comed is AI-powered software designed to enhance emergency department operations and patient care. It speeds up the check-in and check-out process, automates triaging for nurses, monitors patients, and includes an AI medical assistant to help physicians by recommending differential diagnosis, up-to-date treatment options, and ranking relevant medical literature in real-time. I originally built Comed during a 36-hour hackathon and later expanded it with a new sandbox web-app and this landing page for potential customers to try and learn more about.
